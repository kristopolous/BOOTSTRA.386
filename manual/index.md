## Preface

When the headquarters in Boston tasked us with a full-screen interface that supported pointing devices connected through any bus, full color displays, and to work on everything from palmtops to mainframes, and then to have it all fit on a 1.44MB 3.5" floppy, we knew we had our work cut out for us.

Luckily we got together our global team of software developers with resumes from Ashton-Tate to Quarterdeck and everywhere in between was up for the challenge.

This is our story.

## Planning Party

When Nolan Bushnell sold Atari to start Chuck-E-Cheese a few years ago, we joked he was just going lower in the stack - providing the fuel to the fire on Sandhill Road. At least fuel to a team of kids, the oldest of which was 24, who I was eating late night pizza in Menlo Park on a Friday in early January.

We were talking about the future of computing and how it was going to change the office of the 1990s. We had been passing around this book, Smalltalk-80, describing some personal office computers by Xerox, unrelated to their 500 series minicomputers, to be used by just a single non-technical person to do work in a way that obsoletes the mail room, switchboard, and even the secretary.

Xerox had even found a way to make these computers talk to each other similar to how Kahn, Kleinrock and Cerf did with their ARPA project at UCLA but without the giant BBN machine. Instead it was an add-on board - Metcalfe, the inventor, called it Ethernet.

As we ate our pizza, Gilda, a gifted Engineer from overseas, pointed out that this was only going to be useful if non-technical people, without reading manuals, were able to effectively use the computers.

"This is a monumental task", she said, while munching on a slice of pizza, "think about the desk calculator. We can't effecively explain the memory and percent buttons to people, how do you expect those same people to typeset a sales report by themselves?"

The question went unanswered. Xerox's machines sold about as well as cars from South Korea.  People would flip over a mouse and try to roll the ball with their hands like it's one of Bushnell's video games.

Like most conversations this dissappeared into the ether as fever dreams of future imaginaries fueled by fantasy and confusion.

## Visi-on Vision

The drive on Sunday to Vegas was a bit much for the 1973 Winnebego. It was the only vehicle that we could plug a power strip into. Comdex is crucial. If you miss it, then you might as well just go out of business.

It's the one time a year that companies are foolish enough to demo unannouced products and on top of that, send the actual engineers that are working on them. They get exactly zero training on what not to say. If you showered them with enough attention, they'd probably give you their SYSOP password to show how clever they were.

Among engineers the only skill required for spycraft is smiles and flattery.

The back of the Winnebego had 5 kids sitting around 3 microcomputers as I drove down the I-5 past fields of food and cows. So many fragrant cows.

If you haven't had the chance to use a computer yet let me introduce you to the strangeness. You turn it on and the box sounds like it needs muffler. The machine chirps a beep as the screen turns on and you see an incrementing number in the top left. It will go up into the hundreds in increments of 16. This checks what is known as volatile memory, it's what the computer needs to shuffle things around in its brain.

A top of the line computer these days will go up to 640. This takes minutes. Enough for you to make a cup of coffee. 

And then the diskette drives make a disturbing crunching sound as their lights go red, looking to see if anything is there. If it's not, then the default system loads. 

Regardless of the computer there is eventually a prompt which consists of a series of characters followed by a blinking rectangle and then you, the user are tasked with instructing the computer what to do through terse languages with names like "CP/M" and "MS-DOS". Yes, it's all caps with characters in between them. For the first you just say the letters and omit the slash. The second is not Ms. Dos nor is it all the letters, but the MS is spoken and the DOS part rhymes with loss.

And these machines, costing thousands of dollars each, are, eventually, supposed to replace the back-office and be orchestrated by the general public.

Everyone assumes this will be inevitable and people will do all kinds of things on these machines. Look up recipes, casually chat with friends, even store home videos and their record collection. On the black screen with the blinking rectangle.

As I cut across to Bakersfield I adjust the rear view mirror to see the young engineers fully bought into this implausible future. But little did I know, that in 48 hours, a single demo on the floor of the Las Vegas Convention center would make me believe it as well.


We ask the candidate what his idea would look like. 

"Ok, so let's redesign WordStar in your vision. Show us what these pull-downs will look like", I say. "Just get up and draw it."

He draws on the chalkboard this oblong rectangle. Inside it are the words "File" "Edit" "View" "Windows" and "Help". Then he scratches a rectangle around the "File" and says "Alright the user point the mouse at this and then a rectangle below appears" as he places the words "New", "Open", "Open Recent", "Save", "Save As", and "Exit".

Gilda gets up and walks up to him as she picks up her chalk. "Alright but here's the problems." she doesn't even look at the candidate as she starts pressing dots on the chalkboard, "see, File is a noun, Edit and View are verbs. You've just gon from Noun-Verb in the first column to Verb-Noun in the second. And also, why is exiting the program in the File menu? Who would look for it there?"

The candidate looks back at the board and mumbles, "I ... I never thought of that..."

Craig gets up from his chair and walks on over as well. "Sorry, but here's another. So you've split "Save" and "Save As" and "Open" and "Open Recent", why not just put that distinction into a further dialog box? Also one distinction is temporal and the other is canonical."

The candidate turns back and stares at us in utter bafflement, almost as if his world is shattered. 

Gilda shoots back "And what happens when the person clicks on Edit". The candidate innocently stammers, "that's where you can manipulate the clipboard buffer and do things like format the thing you are working on."

The room full of engineers shake their head in disbelief. I was breaking out in a cold sweat, nervous that inviting such a crackpot in would ruin my standing with my team.

The palpable silence breaks by a doorknock as the lead sales rep, Michael tries to pull me away for a call. 

It strikes me that this interview was over but I get an audacious, and perhaps cruel idea to salvage my reputation. I say "Hey Mike, I'm wondering if you can take a few seconds and tell me what you see on the chalkboard". 

Now Mike comes from 20 years at Woolworths, he's en excellent sales guy but really doesn't know much about computers. He's been the "average-user" guinea pig before and has become famous for splashing cold water on the hottest idea.

"Well", Michael starts scratching his head, "it looks like WordStar. That's a nice hierarchy. I hope you're putting formatting and clipboard stuff in the Edit box. Also, that separation in the box under File clears everything up. It's the stuff I want to do with the thing. Add Print in there and it's perfect. This is the first thing I've seen that makes sense. Anyway Chuck, I'll see you in 5." and he closes the door. 

Everyone's mouth is open in shock as the only sound we hear is his squeaky shoes stepping down the carpeted hallway walking away.

I shrug my shoulders and look around the room, "Alright, fuck it." I pause and look for negative rection. Seeing none, I continue "I guess you're hired. See you Monday 9 am. You go by Claude right?"

"Yeah."

Craig murmurs in disbelief, "We should get the security guard in here and see if she can figure it out".

## Claude's world
January 1984 wasn't really a time of significance. It's hard to explain but not all times are equally accessible. There's a topology and the distances are very non-euclidean. It's just as uneven and entropic as everything else this universe creates. For whatever reason, the next easily accessible date that requires under 50KW and wasn't millions of years ago is January 1984, 15 years before I was born. I have about a 5 minute window at 3:32am tonight to catch it otherwise I will be sent off to somewhere in the Proterozoic.

Everyone thinks time travel is going to be glamorous but really, you go back to a time before you were born as nobody. 

No friends, bank account, connections, place to live... 

The best way to travel isn't to get vintage currency, that's expensive. What I do is purchase jewelry at estate sales. Then I pawn it off. At least that way I'll have a few hundred bucks. 

But that money and the rest of the stuff in my Samsonite really doesn't last long. My chance to return won't open up for 6 months and this money will last about 2 weeks if I'm stingy.

What I need is a job. 

Silicon Valley seems obvious since I already knew the future and they will just hire anyone off the street if they sound like they can hack it. This sounds like it would be easy. I had alsways admired BOOTSTRA and BOOTSTRA/386 as revolutionary products in the mid-1980s ever since reading Tracy Kiddel's masterpiece on its development.

I wanted to be there, on those team, in those rooms, involved in those conversations. The artistry, audacity, and irreverance of the early computing revolution before it became the oppressive tastemaker has always captured my interest.

I had forgotten that revolutionaries are controversial at best and being dismissed is the more common response. There was only one Steve Jobs and he ain't me. I was about to learn that the hard way, or maybe, not at all. Regardless, I'm up for the challenge.

The cheap motel I'm staying in is going to be torn down after Loma Linda, replaced with a mall, which will then get torn down and replaced with a 5-over-1 in 2023 but right now it's $15.99/night. 1984 prices, gotta love them.

I guess I get the weekend to myself. It's weird to walk around the place you grew up in and seeing a bunch of things you don't recognize. My favorite third-wave coffee house is a music store with the name "Sam Goody", in the distance all I see is smog and the most exotic foreign food I can find is sushi.

There's all these details you forget about until you're there. People purchasing newspapers from newstands, cigarette vending machines in diners hazes of smoke on the ceilings. Even the cars. You think you know what the cars are going to be.  Did you know that not all cars had side-view mirrors on both sides? There's a bunch without them. 

Even the lights are different. They have harsh bright glows and buzzing sounds, flickering like some kind of video game. And then there's the lack of phones. I've got mine back at the hotel room, sure, along with my mdoern laptop and USB power brick ... I wasn't going to travel completely empty-handed.

But it's not jsut phones, it's screens in general. Small CRTs flicker everywhere with washed out color and have this high pitched squeal when you turn them on. 40 years ago can feel so familiar yet at the same time, so foreign. The NES version of Super Mario Bros is still 18 months in the future.

"What the hell is this thing?", I scoffed, "two terabytes of storage, on chip the size of my fingernail?". I looked at the convincing plastic rectangle festooned with logos and claiming "2TB" by some imaginary company named "Lenovo". Underneath it was bespeckled with tiny yellow colored teeth. I guess this prankster thought they could just slide it in like an Atari 2600 cartridge. Into what I have no idea. Getting 2 kilobytes in this form-factor would have been an accomplishment. It felt as fragile as a tortilla chip.

It was time for me to go. Literally. In 6 months, I built BOOTSTRA/386 and now it my window to leave. I had heard about the legendary Claude with no last name who had brought the microcomputer to the masses and really, during that interview I just used the name as a joke. 

That's always the problem with time-travel, did I become my future reality? Was it inevitable or did I build it? I've entered the grandfather paradox of technology. Maybe putting "Quit" in the File drop down is actually a bad idea. Who knows? It's too late now. The sands of time sweep through all our fingers the same. Windwos close before we realize they were ever open and opportunities enter the world of imagined counterfactuals. 

Our negotiation with time is the most powerful relationship we ostensibly have control over. And yet, it will always have control over us.

I came empty-handed and now I will leave them empty, a mystery of the ages. We were always going to be eclipsed by the Macintosh. That was unavoidable. Building the most legendary forgotten empire with all but a floppy disk and this story to show are my two vast and trunkless legs of stones in the desert. For a glimmer of the past, I was ozymandias, king of kings.

But now, I look on my own works, however mighty, and all they fill me with is dispair.

I set my time machine for 2025 and I pull the lever.
