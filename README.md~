## Less sarcastic introduction

Bootstrap/386 is a [Twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) theme intended to make
webpages look like they are from the 1980s.

### Status

I've been working on this more or less for a year or so --- there's a lot to do. If you'd like to contribute,
please try to hack the components section.

Here's some rules:

  * All text must be vertically aligned.  The letters should start at the same horizontal offset down the page, as a grid
  * All text must be horizontally aligned.  Borders, margins, and paddings must be a function of the height of the font or
    the height of the font / 2 if you are doing some special ASCII-like thing.
  * Foreground colors can be any of the EGA 16 - background can only be the first 8.
  * Things like shadows, darken, lighten, border-radius, underline, italics, bold - none of this is allowed.

TODO:

  * You can use some ASCII shaded characters for background &#9617; &#9618; &#9619; and make a repeating image out of them. But **be careful** as you have to have the background cut off when the text starts in order to maintain the grid rules.

Yes, this is harder than you think.

### Filing Bugs

Preferably, I like a screen shot and context. Here's an example of a good bug:

### About the colors.

##### The EGA-16 color palette

This color palette was available on color terminals as far as back as the IBM XT and AT. It was known
as the 16 color EGA palette.  These 16 colors were available for character mode graphics on CGA cards
and for raster graphics on EGA.  CGA couldn't fully-rasterize all the 16 colors because of the graphics
memory (which was a premium back then) needed. (more about that below).

The resolution at the time was nominally 640x350 pixels. Each character was 8 pixels across and 14 pixels tall.
This gave the classic 80x25 character resolution of the terminals at the time (in DOS known as mode CO25).  For
CGA, the resolution was 640x200 and the character was 8x8 pixels - giving a 1:2.4 pixel aspect ratio since the
pixels here weren't squares.

<q>
<b>Why weren't they squares?</b>
The monitors themselves were 4:3.  Across this was 640 pixels and top to bottom it was 200.  Pretend you had a 15 inch
monitor.  This means that the hypotenuese is 15 inches.  We can use the Pythagorean theorem here:

    (4x)^2 + (3x)^2 = 15^2 ... x = 3

This means that horizontally you had 12 inches viewable and vertically you had 9.  Now,

    640 / 12 = horizontal dpi = 53.3
    200 / 9 = vertical dpi = 22.2

    53.3 / 22.2 =~ 2.4

So our "8x8" actually produced a tall character.  In the EGA world, things were a bit different since we had a 640x350 resolution.
Using the same math from above:

    640 / 12 = horizontal dpi = 53.3
    350 / 9 = vertical dpi = 38.8

    53.3 / 38.8 =~ 1.37

Now remember, we have a 14x8 character resolution for ega, so let's throw that back in

    1.37 * (14 / 8) =~ 2.4

And there we go.  This is why CGA and EGA 16 text graphics look relatively similar. It's because they fit
the same characters on the screen, in the same proportion to the eye, by utilizing different rasterized fonts.
</q>

Each character additionally had a foreground and a background color. This means that video memory cost was at least

    80 rows * 25 columns * 1 byte per character (MSDOS supported 8-bit extended ASCII, see below) * 4/8 bits FG * 3/8 bits BG * 1/8 bits "style"
    80 * 25 * 2 = 4000 bytes.

Standard EGA was 16kB which means that there were 4 pages.

#### The colors themselves

EGA is technically a 64 bit palette, but the 16 'default' colors are what made it famous.  The logic here is that each of the 4 bits were for
one of the channels

  * Bit 0 - brightness
  * Bit 1 - red
  * Bit 2 - green
  * Bit 3 - blue

So this means that 1100 (color 12) is a bright red. You can see the [colors here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_Graphics_Adapter#Color_palette).

For all intents and purposes, the background color was always dark.

## Box drawing


### Lines
Borders back in the day relied on box-drawing ASCII characters which, on the PC were part of the 8-bit Microsoft extension to the official
7-bit ASCII.

There were single and double borders.  Your computer can very likely still render them. Here they are in modern Unicode, now also part of 
something called WGL 4.0.

We have 

  * corners: &#9484; &#9488; &#9492; &#9496;
  * intersections: &#9500; &#9508; &#9516; &#9525; &#9532;
  * lines: &#9472; &#9474;

Then there were double versions of them, for example, &#9574; or &#9567;.

The important thing here is that because these were characters, you didn't get clean backgrounds using them. Here's an example:

<img src=http://techpubs.sgi.com/library/dynaweb_docs/0530/SGI_EndUser/books/SWin_UG/sgi_html/figures/57a.exitdosedit.gif>


So this means that when drawing a box, if we are using a different color background, it has to overflow a bit in order to be accurate.

Here is a diagram pulled from the net:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/JtnxeDy.gif">

These are part of something that is now called the "WGL4" character set. You can see a list with the modern Unicode equivalents [following this link](http://www.alanwood.net/demos/wgl4.html). They are used sparingly in the code.

### Solids and Shading

There are partially filled solids that could be one of the EGA colors. These are: 

 * the full character: &#9608;
 * half characters: &#9600; &#9604; &#9612; &#9616;

There's also 3 "greys" which are full boxes with "shading": &#9617; &#9618; &#9619;

### All together now!

What this means is that if you want say, a 3d popup box with a shadow, like this:

<img src=http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/bsgfx/microsoft/msdos/msdos50-scr-02.jpg>

inside of a div, things can get tricky.  You have 

  * the margin to the border
  * The grey border itself at 1px
  * a box-shadow that extends beyond the div
  * a second box shadow that extends beyond the first

Or you need to wrap these things artificially in code. Additionally, look at the border above.  On the right hand you have
a border that is the width of 2 characters, offset down by a full character.  But in our world, all offsets go off the center
of the border, so the math has to be done differently to make this work and have everything line up.
