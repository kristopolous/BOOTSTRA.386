## Hogan.js - A mustache compiler.

[Hogan.js](http://twitter.github.com/hogan.js/) is a compiler for the
[Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) templating language. For information
on Mustache, see the [manpage](http://mustache.github.com/mustache.5.html) and
the [spec](https://github.com/mustache/spec).

## Basics

Hogan compiles templates to HoganTemplate objects, which have a render method.

```js
var data = {
  screenName: "dhg",
};

var template = Hogan.compile("Follow @{{screenName}}.");
var output = template.render(data);

// prints "Follow @dhg."
console.log(output);
```

## Features

Hogan is fast--try it on your workload.

Hogan has separate scanning, parsing and code generation phases. This way it's
possible to add new features without touching the scanner at all, and many
different code generation techniques can be tried without changing the parser.

Hogan exposes scan and parse methods. These can be useful for
pre-processing templates on the server.

```js
var text = "{{^check}}{{#i18n}}No{{/i18n}}{{/check}}";
text +=  "{{#check}}{{#i18n}}Yes{{/i18n}}{{/check}}";
var tree = Hogan.parse(Hogan.scan(text));

// outputs "# check"
console.log(tree[0].tag + " " + tree[0].name);

// outputs "Yes"
console.log(tree[1].nodes[0].nodes[0]);
```

It's also possible to use HoganTemplate objects without the Hogan compiler
present. That means you can pre-compile your templates on the server, and
avoid shipping the compiler. However, the optional lambda features from the
Mustache spec do require the compiler to be present.

## Why Hogan.js?

Why another templating library?

Hogan.js was written to meet three templating library requirements: good
performance, standalone template objects, and a parser API.
